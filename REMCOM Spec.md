# REMCOM MVP Specification

## Objective
Deliver a streamlined, web-based enforcement tool that allows roadside officials to manually process and reconcile Warrants of Arrest (WoAs) and outstanding notices for vehicles and driversâ€”without relying on ANPR, handheld devices, or mobile scanners.

---

## MVP Scope & Features

### 1. Manual Data Entry Interface
- Officers can manually input:
  - Driver ID number
  - Vehicle registration number

### 2. Centralised WoA/Notice Lookup
- Query and display all outstanding notices or WoAs linked to the entered ID or vehicle.
- Clearly distinguish between driver-linked and vehicle-linked entries.

### 3. Actionable Enforcement Interface
- Officers can mark:
  - WoA as executed
  - Fine or notice as paid
- Editing allowed only with authenticated user sessions.
- All actions logged with immutable audit trail.

### 4. Receipt and Warrant Issuance
- Generate and display printable PDFs:
  - Payment receipts
  - Executed warrants

### 5. TRAFMAN Integration (Basic Export)
- Generate a daily transaction file in XML format for manual upload into TRAFMAN.
- Include all available data: payments, executions, timestamps, user IDs.

### 6. Admin and Reconciliation Module
- Admins can:
  - View and verify logs of payments and WoA executions
  - Manually upload reconciliation XML files
  - Detect and resolve mismatches (e.g., duplicates, amount discrepancies)

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Authentication**: Username/password login, session expires after 30 minutes
- **Audit Logging**: Immutable logs of all actions (who, what, when)
- **Performance**: Offline-first support deferred to future enhancement
- **Security**: HTTPS-only, encrypted sensitive data, OWASP top 10 compliance

## Out of Scope for MVP

- ANPR integration
- Handheld/PDA scanning or apps
- Real-time mobile sync
- Automatic vehicle redirection flow
- Payment gateway integration (all payments recorded as manual)
